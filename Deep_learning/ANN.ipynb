    "    - it is especially used for models where we have to predict the probability as an output.\n",
    "    - When the output value is close to 1, the neuron is active and enables the flow of information, while a value close to 0 corresponds to an inactive neuron.\n",

    "    - similar behavior with the sigmoid function. Thus, the main difference is the fact that the tanh function pushes the input values to 1 and -1 instead of 1 and 0.\n",

    "**Phase 2**\n",
    "1. When the model generates **Multiple unreliable outputs**, In needs to be given Feedback, So that it can improve. So A **Cost Function** is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cost function :**  It is measures of error between the predicted and actual values and helps the network to adjust its weights and biases to make accurate predictions.\n",
    "    - The goal is to find the minimum value of the cost function, which corresponds to the best set of weights and biases that make accurate predictions.\n",

    "### Steps for Implementation :\n",
    "1. Randomly initialize the weights to small number close to 0(but not 0).\n",
    "2. Input the first observation of your dataset in the input layer, each feature in one input node.\n",
    "3. Forward-Propagation: from left to right, the neurons are activated in a way that impact of each neuron's activation is limited by the weights. Propagate the activations until getting the predicted result y.\n",
    "4. Compare the predicted result to the actual result. Measure the generated error.\n",
    "5. Back-Propagation: from right to left, the error is back-Propogated. Update the weights according to how much they are responsible for the error. The learninig rate decides by how much we update the weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Repeat Steps 1 to 5 and update the weights after each observation (Reinforcement learning) Or :  Steps 1 to 5 and update the weights only after a batch of observations (Batch Learning).\n",
